# incidental fox productivity

Digitizing my productivity system, integrating the toggl and todoist apis

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Next To Dos

### mvp

use todos and time entries to fill in either side of the timeline with time chunks
fix time zones
build interface to add times and durations to todoist tasks so they can fill the left side
scaffold and implement all database functions in function folder
layout habit tracker/theme page (2 week sections) [no data]
set up the journal page [no data]
layout dashboard [ no data ]
add the theme / schedule / journal links to nav with relevant animations
build the journal, theme, habit data structure for firebase
build stores and functions to access then tie into layout

### fixes for later

find a real solution for having the projects refresh only after the user auth has loaded in instead of just a timeout

### features for later

set up the full width versions of the toggl v todoist view
drag n drop and resize on time bars
graphic design on tasks and time entries to float based on when they're on the schedule
animate the time bars
logo design
add more developed auth rules for firebase (fireship course)

### features for much later

turn the time bars into circles like the journal
customize colors and projects
deeper reports in a calendar view
follow specific tasks, build trends
